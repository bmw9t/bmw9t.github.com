If you're reading this, you probably found your way here through my dissertation. And you're probably looking for the listening examples that I cite in it. The audio archive originally hosted here has been migrated to LibraData, UVA's open access scholarly data repository. To listen, head over to the dataset published there at this DOI - [https://doi.org/10.18130/V3/NXYRB9](https://doi.org/10.18130/V3/NXYRB9).
