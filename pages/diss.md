If you're reading this, you probably found your way here through my dissertation. And you're probably looking for the listening examples that I cite in it. To comply with copyright, I have migrated my dissertation's audio archive [here](http://diss.herokuapp.com). To get access to it, please write to me at walsh [dot] virginia [dot] edu. I'll be happy to send you the credentials.
