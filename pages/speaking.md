I've been giving workshops and presentations on a variety of topics related to digital humanities and pedagogy for several years. Many of the materials for these events are available on my [blog](http://localhost:4000/archive). Reach out to me at walsh@virginia.edu if you would like to discuss working with your institution for an event. In addition to the examples below, I regularly talk about digital humanities pedagogy, curricular development, DH technical training (with a special focus on beginners), and digital project planning.
