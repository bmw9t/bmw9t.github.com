Q1 We are at the early planning stages of developing a teacher resource called Teaching Hard Literature, which would be a complement to the Teaching Hard History framework and resources: [https://www.tolerance.org/frameworks/teaching-hard-history/american-slavery](https://www.tolerance.org/frameworks/teaching-hard-history/american-slavery). To help us to think about what such a resource should offer, we would like to learn about your relation to the kind of texts that seem to you to raise important “hard” issues but that you or others you know may be reluctant to teach.
