Well, that's a wrap. The Praxis students presented reveal.scholarslab.org to an utterly packed house last Friday (more on that project below), which means that the first full cycle of Scholars' Lab student programs under my watch has taken place. It feels like I just got here, but, as I like to mark milestones, it felt worth reflecting on a few lessons from this year. At the same time, I've found myself often describing a few basic theoretical and practical tensions at the heart of our fellowship programs to anyone who is interested in what we do, so it seems worth writing down my thoughts on them in a wider, more public forum. This post, then, will aim to do both of those things by talking about the line we try to walk between student-centered learning and project-centered learning. In short, I'll be talking about how we figure out what the Praxis program works on each year.

Some background and practical considerations. The Praxis Program is just one of our fellowship programs each year, but, as it serves more students, I think it's safe to say that it takes up the most mental energy of everyone in the lab. Each year, we take six humanities students from various departments around the University (next year we'll have our first Architecture School student!) and offer them a soup-to-nuts introduction to digital humanities work.
