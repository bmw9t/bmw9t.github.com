Well, that's a wrap. The Praxis students presented reveal.scholarslab.org to an utterly packed house last Friday (more on that project below), which means that the first full cycle of Scholars' Lab student programs under my watch has taken place. It feels like I just got here, but, as I like to mark milestones, it felt worth reflecting on a few lessons from this year. At the same time, I've found myself often describing a few basic theoretical and practical tensions at the heart of our fellowship programs to anyone who is interested in what we do, so it seems worth writing down my thoughts on them in a wider, more public forum. This post, then, will aim to do both of those things by talking about the line we try to walk between student-centered learning and project-centered learning. In short, I'll be talking about how we figure out what the Praxis program works on each year.

Some background and practical considerations. The Praxis Program is just one of our fellowship programs each year, but, as it serves more students, I think it's safe to say that it takes up the most mental energy of everyone in the lab. Each year, we take six humanities students from various departments around the University (next year we'll have our first Architecture School student!) and offer them a soup-to-nuts introduction to digital humanities work. You can read more about the program on [the project website](http://praxis.scholarslab.org/about/), [the abstract for the poster that was done when the project first launched](http://www.dh2012.uni-hamburg.de/conference/programme/abstracts/realigning-digital-humanities-training-the-praxis-program-at-the-scholars-lab.1.html), or in this [introductory post by Bethany Nowviskie](http://scholarslab.org/grad-student-research/announcing-the-praxis-program/). The program draws together several strands of pedagogical theory, a sampling of which might include Paulo Freire's _Pedagogy of the Oppressed_, the [UCLA Student Collaborator's Bill of Rights](http://cdh.ucla.edu/news/a-student-collaborators-bill-of-rights/). Rather than dig deeper here, I'll just say that we're working on a charter to explicitly lay out more of this context for the work we do. So stay tuned!

One thing I've been thinking a lot about this year is the primary vehicle by which we facilitate the learning process in this program - the project. I usually put it thus: Praxis is a year-long fellowship that has a distinctive shift in feel between the fall and spring semesters. In the fall, there is still a fair amount of us in the front of the class giving workshops to the students, as you might expect from a class where they will be learning a lot of technology. But we also share a range of strategies and techniques that aim to give a high-level look at all the different components of digital work - intellectual property, project scoping and management, collaboration planning, and way more (you can check out the common curriculum [here](http://praxis.scholarslab.org/curriculum/)). Most importantly, we help them think about what they'll be doing together during the year: we help them design and scope a project that they'll be working on in the spring, when we shift to much more of a hands-on, side-by-side, lab approach to the learning experience. While we still think a lot in the spring, our day-to-day work is mostly taken up working together to make the thing happen.

I want to talk about the project. In the introductory post by Bethany above, she mentions that
