  <div class="entry-content"><p>This past weekend I coached at <a href="http://railsgirls.com/digitalhumanities_fairfax">Rails Girls Digital Humanities</a> at the <a href="http://chnm.gmu.edu/">Roy Rosenzweig Center for History and New Media</a>. The event was amazing, the women were inspiring, and the tacos were delicious. It was just wonderful to take a first attempt at teaching Ruby on Rails in a community that was so supportive and welcoming! I learned a lot about teaching from the day. Here are a few thoughts on the experience and on how I would be a better coach in the future.</p>

<p><strong>Deep Technical Problems</strong><br />
At my table we ran into a couple problems where Rails refused to play nicely with the version of Windows a student was running. After working on the problem for a while, it became clear that I wasn’t going to be able to solve the issue in the time allotted. I eventually lent the student my laptop so that she could keep learning and building during the course of the afternoon. Of course, this is only a temporary fix, as the Rails issues would come up again when the student got home and tried to continue working. Is the tradeoff worth it? Or did I just delay the frustration until she was home? In the future it might help to have a designated Rails installation expert hanging around that wasn’t coaching to help troubleshoot tech problems like these that show up later, after the installation party is over.</p>

<p><strong>Syntax</strong><br />
Syntax errors often posed the biggest teaching challenge for me. What do you do when you see that the problem is in the syntax before the student does? Suggesting to a student that the issue is with the syntax gave me the feeling that I was withholding information from her, which I can only imagine felt irritating. But I don’t think jumping in to point out mistakes is any good for long-term skill building either. Fellow coach <a href="http://anglophileinacademia.blogspot.com/">Annie Swafford</a> suggested that I use moments like these to teach the process by which I would find a syntax error, and I could definitely do a better job of this in the future. In the context of following a tutorial like the Rails Girls guides, this would mean a few steps. First, I double-check each line meticulously with one finger on my code and another on the tutorial. Second, I read the offending code backwards bit by bit to get my mind away from thinking about the lines semantically, which often tricks you into overlooking things. As a last resort, I copy and paste the tutorial code over top of my own. If nothing changes, I know there is no syntax error and that I need to look elsewhere. Finally, I search online for answers.</p>

<p><strong>Frustration</strong><br />
It’s important to learn that we <em>all</em> break things. Constantly. I tried to stress again and again that I spend far more time breaking and fixing than I do actually building things that function properly. In the future I might even bring copies of some of my own commit messages (<a href="https://github.com/scholarslab/prism/commit/8fba94b904219d42b5d270660d04a4bef69ed034">1</a>, <a href="https://github.com/scholarslab/prism/commit/bfae5eca226dfc8cbbee86f6acbfe63ec0c8c07f">2</a>, <a href="https://github.com/scholarslab/prism/commit/1fbba70b3577d093430426f7b4ee34752aa5c64c">3</a>, <a href="https://github.com/scholarslab/prism/commit/be0a319c44d6d2b3f894168cc26044ff42642c2e">4</a>, <a href="https://github.com/scholarslab/prism/commit/0af47e4d214f1c994714223f93c11801975f09d0">5</a>) to illustrate the point and get some laughs. This feeling of helplessness, obviously, can be incredibly frustrating. Rails Girls DH made me wonder: how much frustration is pedagogically useful? How can we teach frustration in such a way that it doesn’t cause students to shut down? One of the hardest parts of coaching was learning to balance my instinct to help with the need to allow people to struggle. The women did an <em>amazing</em> job working through and learning from issues that popped up, but I wonder if I was doing the best job possible to facilitate their learning. As a coach, do you jump in the moment someone’s face expresses annoyance? Or, do you wait for them to reach out to you? I think at times I was too willing to read facial expressions and jump in to help, possibly out of a feeling that I wasn’t doing enough. Students should learn to feel confident and independent in their tech abilities, and they will only develop these traits by dealing with and pushing through their own frustrations. They should feel that they can ask for help, but they should also learn when they can handle something on their own. In general, I think the women I worked with were better at knowing when to ask for help than I was at knowing when to offer it.</p>

<p>So, if I were coaching again, I would do the following differently:<br />
1. Bring an extra laptop.<br />
2. Learn more about the Rails installation process and known issues with different operating systems ahead of time so that I am better equipped to troubleshoot such things.<br />
3. Talk more about processes: of troubleshooting, of asking for and finding help, and even of conceptualizing new projects.<br />
4. Strike a more satisfying balance between jumping in and letting students explore independently.  </p>

<p>I’m already looking forward to the next Rails Girls DH event!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Sometimes things go wrong. When this happens, I often find a temporary solution that works fine in the moment, but implementing the fix repeatedly can get annoying over time. Here is something that I had been ignoring for a while and only recently took the time to fix.</p>

<p>I use <a href="https://github.com/revans/bash-it">bash-it</a>, which has lots of neat tricks and functions. Since installing it, however, I had been getting a message every time I open up a terminal window:</p>

<p><code>sorry, the z plugin is incompatible with the fasd plugin. you may use either, but not both.</code></p>

<p>The message doesn’t stop you from going about your business, so I never really read it very closely: bash-it tells you everything you need to know. When installing, bash-it prompts you to make a variety of decisions about how many plugins you will use on a regular basis. I told bash-it to enable everything by default, but this decision caused a conflict between two plugins.</p>

<p>To see which plugins you have enabled, open a terminal window and type:</p>

<p><code>$ bash-it show plugins</code></p>

<p>In the output, you should see some flavor of the following diagnosing the problem:</p>

<p><code>z [x]     maintains a jump-list of the directories you actually use  
z is DEPRECATED, use fasd instead</code></p>

<p>Plugin z causes an error when activated with a newer plugin with the same functionality. Bash-it gives you the fix:</p>

<p><code>$ bash-it disable plugin z</code></p>

<p>After that, your terminal should run free of the message.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This one is for my own files as much as anything else. For some time now, I’ve been getting a persistent error in Git when I try to go through the steps of committing a file online. This particular error came about when trying to pull before pushing up to GitHub:</p>

<p><code>/usr/bin/mate -w: /usr/bin/mate: No such file or directory
error: There was a problem with the editor '/usr/bin/mate -w'.
Not committing merge; use 'git commit' to complete the merge.</code></p>

<p>From what I understand, this comes about because Git can’t find the symbolic link to TextMate, even though it has existed in the past. For whatever reason, this issue seems to come up from time to time on my machine. I’ve tried a number of different solutions online, but none seemed to take.
<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9610884/cant-create-a-symbolic-link-with-textmate-in-terminal-mate-command-not-found">This</a> solution finally did it for me. First, of course, make sure that you have TextMate installed and updated (my first mistake). The solution:</p>

<p><code>ln -s /Applications/TextMate.app/Contents/SharedSupport/Support/bin/mate /usr/local/bin/mate</code></p>

<p>This very post was made free of the error.  </p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The web enables virtually all of my work as a graduate student, but it can all too easily become a powerful distraction. Sometimes it helps to have a few practical aids in the war against procrastination. Of the several tools that I’ve tried - <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/foxfilter/">Fox Filter</a>, <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stayfocusd/laankejkbhbdhmipfmgcngdelahlfoji?hl=en">StayFocused</a>, and <a href="http://macfreedom.com/">Freedom</a> - <a href="http://selfcontrolapp.com/">SelfControl</a> remains my favorite. SelfControl provides relentless self-regulating freedom from procrastination. Best of all, it is free.</p>

<p><img src="/images/Self_Control_1.jpg" width="60%" class="left" /></p>

<p>SelfControl is an app for Mac OS X that, unlike FoxFilter or StayFocused, works across browsers. When enabled, SelfControl asks you to specify how long you want to block a list of domains, up to 24 hours. The app also sports a “Whitelist” function that works in reverse, disabling everything except for a handful of specified domains. </p>

<p>Once activated, the blocks remain live until a particularly menacing timer runs down, and only some minor computer hacking will allow you to disable the app’s functionality. This relentlessness is SelfControl’s best and worst feature. The timed function is particularly good for short bursts of productivity, ie. an hour or shorter, but disabling the web for any longer feels too risky: it is easy to imagine time-sensitive emails going unanswered because you have blocked access to the internet for the next five hours. </p>

<p><img src="/images/Self_Control_2.jpg" class="right" /></p>

<p>At its best, SelfControl allows me to temper the impulse to spend a lot of time hovering around my inbox; I tend to use SelfControl in hour long chunks to allow sessions of distraction-free work in between e-mail checks. How do you stay productive during long hours on the computer?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>All last year I was a <a href="http://praxis.scholarslab.org/">Praxis Fellow</a> in the <a href="http://www.scholarslab.org/">Scholars’ Lab</a>, where they gave us a “soup to nuts” crash course in all things digital humanities.

<p>I did not do a good job of continually cross-posting those blog posts to this site, so I wanted to make sure that they were properly linked here. I posted with the program on a variety of topics from my work as a developer, to reflections on collaborative programming, to our own plan for the year. Many of the posts relate to <a href="http://www.prism.scholarslab.org">Prism</a>, the tool we built over the course of the year.
