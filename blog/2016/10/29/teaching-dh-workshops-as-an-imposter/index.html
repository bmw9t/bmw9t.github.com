<div class="entry-content"><p><em>[The following is a revised version (fewer animal memes) of my half of a talk I recently gave with Sarah Storti. The talk was for a follow-up event on <a href="https://news.blogs.wlu.edu/2014/01/30/wl-announces-digital-humanities-partnership-with-uva/">a digital humanities collaboration between UVA and W&amp;L</a> funded by the <a href="http://colleges.org/">Associated Colleges of the South</a>. The short version is that the grant funded UVA graduate students to lead workshops on digital humanities in W&amp;L undergraduate classrooms. The presentations at the event were meant to give background on the grant and encourage students to get involved with related opportunities, <a href="http://news.blogs.wlu.edu/2015/07/13/mellon-foundation-grants-wl-funds-for-digital-humanities-study-of-history/">now funded through the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation</a>. Crossposted on the WLUDH blog.]</em></p>

<p>I work in the University Library at Washington and Lee University as their Mellon Digital Humanities Fellow. But it is my past that’s relevant today - until just a year ago I was a graduate student here at UVA, where I received my PhD from the English Department. I was a Praxis Fellow in the <a href="scholarslab.org">Scholars’ Lab</a>, where I also held a digital humanities graduate fellowship. When I got involved with this collaboration with W&amp;L, however, I was still very new to digital humanities - I had only been programming for about eight months. My talk today is really pitched at people in similar positions, so if you’re a graduate student here and you’re thinking - “You know, I would really like to participate in this program and give a talk at Washington and Lee. But I’m really just not ready yet. Give me a couple years” - this talk is for you. I understand where you’re coming from. I want to say just a few words about how I overcame such anxieties, why you might want to do so, and, what’s more, how this self-deprecating attitude can actually be an asset in the classroom if you don’t let it get the best of you.</p>

<p>First a few words on what I actually taught when I was invited to speak at Washington and Lee. I was asked to go to W&amp;L and teach software development in a humanities context. I only had a couple hours with the students, and I could not assume that they had any background in programming anyway. I was pretty anxious about what I could realistically accomplish in so little time under those constraints. I decided to approach the problem through design literacy, by helping the students to notice skills that they already had. I put images of websites before them like this:</p>

<p><img src="/images/webdesign.png" alt="poor web design" /></p>

<p>Most of the students would have a visceral reaction to sites like these, to which I responded, “OK. You’re reacting negatively to this site. Why?” Asking them to focus on specific details, we made a list of negative attributes. Then, we tried to intuit the positive principles for good web design that were implied behind the negative observations. If the students thought the site was too cluttered, their reaction implied that websites should have a hierarchy of visual information. If they did not know what was going on, it suggested that good websites tell you their priorities right away. In the case of digital humanities sites, this meant that the underlying research questions would be visible at once. There were a few ideas behind this exercise:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“Bad” web design is really just good web design waiting to be revealed.</li>
  <li>All weak web design could be made better by focusing on small details.</li>
  <li>The students knew more about web design then they might have suspected.</li>
</ul>

<p>The exercise was a way of showing the students that they already knew quite a lot about what makes up good web design even if they didn’t realize it. The activity aimed to crack open the black box of these conversations and show them they could participate in them as well, regardless of their own technological background. I was trying to meet those students that felt like imposters halfway to show them that they were no such thing. And in that very moment, I felt like a huge imposter.</p>

<p>[Aside: lest you think that I am karmically deficient, I also used my own websites as objects of critique. One student was particularly cutting in his criticisms of a photo that I used on an old website in which he thought I had a mustache. I did not - <a href="/old-site/me.jpg">judge for yourself</a>”. The mustache-criticisms continue to this day.)]</p>

<p>Let me back up. I moved past the parameters for the workshop pretty quickly. Let’s review:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Teach software development</li>
  <li>To non-programmers</li>
  <li>In two hours</li>
</ul>

<p>That’s a pretty tall order for someone new to digital humanities. A this point I had been kicking around various forms of programming for just over a year for <a href="https://prism.scholarslab.org">Prism</a> and <a href="https://nines.org">NINES</a>. I felt like I barely knew anything at all, let enough to take on something like this. I thought I was in no shape to take this on, and I had no idea where to even begin planning for such a thing. But I did know that I wanted to give it ago, and it’s a testament to the care given by the <a href="https://scholarslab.org">Scholars’ Lab</a> mentors that I took the plunge and tried my hand anyway. In the very moment that I was trying to help the students move beyond their own self-criticisms, I was suffering from imposter syndrome myself.</p>

<p>Many of you might already be familiar with the concept of imposter syndrome, but I’ll pause just briefly on it nonetheless. If you’re sitting here thinking that you don’t quite have the preparation necessary to hop into a classroom and teach students things like this, the next few minutes are meant for you. When I first heard about the concept as a young imposter, I found the idea to be quite empowering. If you are sitting there thinking, “this is news to me! I’ve gone through life with blithe self-confidence as long as I can remember!” Sorry - you’ll find the rest of the talk boring. You can just reflect on how great you are - I give permission!</p>

<p>In reality, I would wager that everyone here has felt like an imposter at some point. In my notes here I had planned to ask how many of you feel or have felt like imposters, but I won’t. (A senior faculty member interjected here to say that the feeling never goes away, but I swear that he wasn’t a plant.) Imposter syndrome, as described in an <a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/TanyaXShort/20140716/220938/Overcoming_Impostors_Syndrome.php">excellent article by Tanya X. Short</a>, refers to the idea that your successes are, in some sense, not earned. It manifests in many different forms, but, in the kind I’m describing here, I am using it to refer to the sense that, at any moment, someone might burst into the room, point at you, and out you for a lack of knowledge, training, etc. Your particular anxieties may be less dramatic than mine.</p>

<p>Another way to think about the feeling is through this excellent graphic, which I also found in Short’s article but that comes from <a href="http://thisisindexed.com/2012/05/two-annoying-problems/">thisisindexed.com</a>:</p>

<p><img src="/images/impostersyndrome.png" alt="imposter syndrome" /></p>

<p>The idea is that the more you learn about a task the worse you think you are at that task. You might think of it this way: the more you learn about something, the more aware you are of what you don’t know. And this great unknown can hang like a dark cloud over your head, making you feel like you can’t contribute to something that you might actually be quite good at. </p>

<p>So today I want to offer just a few of the reasons why you might want to push back against feelings like this (again, let me recommend <a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/TanyaXShort/20140716/220938/Overcoming_Impostors_Syndrome.php">Short’s article</a> for further recommendations for healing from imposter syndrome). And I’ll go further to suggest that being an imposter can actually make you a more effective teacher.</p>

<p>But first: some things to be gained from overcoming imposter syndrome in this context. A teaching opportunity like this might you uncomfortable because it’s new, but this is precisely what makes it great. As graduate students, we tend to be trained and credentialed to teach in our own departmental silos. Digital humanities teaching opportunities can seem scary because, after all, they’re interdisciplinary. If you don’t know all the aspects of something, it can be frightening to teach it. But I’d argue that this is good practice for the rest of your teaching lives, where you will be called upon to teach a variety of things unfamiliar or alien to you. Put another way: this opportunity can be exciting. Think of it as a chance to teach to learn. There are few better ways to consolidate your thinking on a subject than to attempt to distill it for an audience of beginners, and to me digital humanities is no different. Learn to translate those skills, methods, and interests into teaching materials. Produce one-off teaching packages like this. You’ll learn a lot from the experience, a lot that you can talk about on the job market. After all, you will have had the opportunity to teach students a small liberal arts context, which is different from the setting here at UVA. You’ll have a better sense of the kind of teacher you are as well - know more about what works for you and what you value in the classroom. The most useful thing you can do for yourself professionally is start saying yes when you think you are out of your depth. I’ve been extremely fortunate in that I have found kind mentors, friends, and colleagues who have been willing to encourage me to do so.</p>

<p>I now work at Washington and Lee largely on the strength of the experiences and contacts I made through this teaching opportunity. At W&amp;L, I’m sort of a jack-of-all-trades. I give one-off workshops on say, basic introductions to text analysis. I also teach full courses - a writing course on digital surveillance and a literature course on “Hacking the Book” are both forthcoming. A longer collaboration has involved me co-teaching with a colleague in the history department, Professor Sarah Horowitz, on “Scandal, Crime, and Spectacle in the 19th century,” a course that also features a significant amount of digital text analysis. I also do development work on faculty projects such as a <a href="http://www.huondauvergne.org/">digital edition of a medieval Franco-Italian poem</a> or an <a href="http://shen-rails.herokuapp.com/">interface that allows you to explore a database of entries for a local literary journal</a>. I also (theoretically) work on my own <a href="https://bmw9t.github.io/digital-projects/">research interests</a> in sound studies and digital text analysis.</p>

<p>Lest you thinking of this as a narcissistic aside [pause, reader, for raucous laughter], I mention this for a couple reasons. For one, I know that as graduate students many of you have a healthy amount of concern over the job market. Or, you might be thinking that you don’t actually <em>want</em> to continue on in academia, and that’s OK! I want to offer this narrative as an example of what an alternative career option might be for you. I am embedded in a library, a space that values my degree and intellectual contributions, still very much doing academic work. Alternative academic, or alt-ac, career options like these are viable alternatives for you, but it can be difficult to know what they look like or how to prepare for them. Opportunities like the ones given through this collaboration are way in. So hopefully my narrative can help give shape to your thinking.</p>

<p>But I also think of my job as really being about inhabiting that space of imposterdom that I was talking about a moment ago. I am constantly being asked to do things that I don’t know how to do, to teach things that I’m learning the first time. More importantly, I’m constantly being asked to help people who <em>also</em> feel like they are new to this. So many of my students say “I’m not a computer person” or “I’m an English major, so obviously I won’t be able to do this.” I really see my role as a teacher, faculty member, and human as being about reaching people in these moments. Imposter to imposter. I want people feeling similar anxieties about inadequacy to know that they can handle these topics, that there is a support network to help them do so.</p>

<p>So to the imposters in the room: my people. As an imposter, what can you contribute? What can you give? Beyond the actual content of your curriculum, I want to suggest that being an imposter can be very useful in the classroom. That student who feels like they don’t and won’t get it? You know where they’re coming from. Your own feelings of imposterdom can help you approach teaching with a sense of kindness, empathy, and respect for your students. After all, <a href="https://www.xkcd.com/1053/">no one is born knowing this stuff</a>, and feeling like an imposter means you might just be more likely to feel that in your bones. </p>

<p>So own your imposterdom. I know it’s not easy (<a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/TanyaXShort/20140716/220938/Overcoming_Impostors_Syndrome.php">Tanya Short, again, can help</a>), but it’s worth it. But if it means helping someone else do so as well, the effort is worth it. </p>
