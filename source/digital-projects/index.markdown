While the blogroll has miscellaneous scribblings, these are the more complete/robust projects that I have worked on. In addition to my work on projects at <a href="https://digitalhumanities.wlu.edu">DH at W&L</a>, I also maintain a <a href="https://www.github.com/bmw9t">github repository</a> where I regularly contribute code for a range of projects in a variety of stages of completeness.

<h2>Hearing Silent Woolf</h2>

<img class="small right" src="{{ root_url }}/images/woolf.jpg" alt="woolf face"></a><div class="clear"/>

Python project that uses natural language processing and machine learning to perform distant readings of Virginia Woolf's use of quotation marks. The study aims to chart Woolf's use of moments that imply speech even when no punctuation is present. The project won first prize for the digital humanities panel I was on at the <a href="http://gradcouncil.com/2015-sessions/">2015 Huskey Research Exhibition at UVA</a>, and it was the basis for a fellowship in digital humanities in UVA's <a href="https://www.scholarslab.org">Scholars' Lab</a>. The project was carried out with significant contributions from Eric Rochester, Head of Research and Development in the Lab, and our code can be found on our <a href="https://www.github.com/bmw9t/woolf">GitHub repository</a>.

<h2>Prism</h2>
<img class="mid right" src="{{ root_url }}/images/digital-projects/prism.png" alt="prism visualize page"><div class="clear"/>
<a href="https://www.prism.scholarslab.org">Prism</a> is a browser-based Ruby on Rails application that facilitates text analysis among large groups of people. Built by the <a href="https://www.praxis.scholarslab.org">Praxis Program</a> at the <a href="https://www.scholarslab.org">Scholars' Lab</a>. I came on during the second year of development and have served lead developer since (though the tool is no longer in active development). The tool has gotten significant uptake by K-12 educators.

<h2>Humanities Programming</h2>
<img class="mid right" src="{{ root_url }}/images/humanities_programming.png"><div class="clear"/>

Each summer I run a course on "Humanities Programming" at <a href="https://dhtraining.org/">Humanities Intensive Learning and Training (HILT)</a>. Piloted by Wayne Graham and Jeremy Boggs, I took over and now lead the course with Ethan Reed. The course is meant to be an intensive introduction to programming for non-programmers that takes students through command line, git, HTML5/CSS, Ruby, and Rails. By the end, students will have tinkered on and deployed their own Ruby on Rails application. Materials can be found on our <a href="https://humanitiesprogramming.github.io">course site.</a>

<h2>NINES</h2>
<img class="mid right" src="{{ root_url }}/images/nines.png"><div class="clear"/>

From 2013 to 2015 I acted as Project Manager of the <a href="https://www.nines.org">Networked Infrastructure of Nineteenth-Century Electronic Scholarship (NINES)</a>. NINES peer reviews digital archives pertaining to the nineteenth-century and aggregated that content into a federated, searchable index. As Project Manager I facilitated this process by wrangling reviewers, cleaning metadata, and facilitating the indexing process.

<h2>Grounds for Argument</h2>
<img class="mid right" src="{{ root_url }}/images/grounds_for_argument.png"><div class="clear"/>
<a href="http://www.groundsforargument.org/drupal/welcome">Grounds for Argument</a> is an online Drupal resource for teaching writing and editing along the lines of the Little Red Schoolhouse approach as it was pioneered at the University of Chicago. I worked on the project for two consecutive summers, first contributing content to the many lessons and second as a backend developer facilitating transitions in our hosting platforms and carrying out various technical requests from the team.
