As background for this talk, WRITE SOMETHING ABOUT THE COLLABORATION

I'm Brandon Walsh, and I work in the library at Washington and Lee University as their Mellon Digital Humanities Fellow. But it is my past that's relevant today - until just a year ago I was a graduate student here at UVA. I received my PhD from the English Department. I was a Praxis Fellow in the Scholars' Lab, where I also had a digital humanities graduate fellowship. My talk today is really pitched at this audience, so if you're a graduate student here and you're thinking - "You know, I would really like to participate in this program and give a talk at Washington and Lee. But I'm really just not ready yet. Give me a couple years" - this talk is for you. I understand where you're coming from, but want to say just a few words about how I overcame such anxieties, why you might want to do so, and, what's more, how this self-depricating attitude can actually be an asset in the classroom.

So I was asked to go to Washington and Lee and teach software development in a humanities context. I only had a couple hours, and I couldn't assume that the students had any background in programming anyway. What could I realistically accomplish in so little time under those constraints? I decided to approach the problem through design literacy, by helping the students to notice skills that they already had. I put images of websites before them like this:
