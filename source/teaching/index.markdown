<h3><a name="IHGC3559"></a>IHGC 3559: "American Youth and Film"</h3>

This seminar focuses on post-WWII American films made about or for teenagers and adolescents. The changing conceptions of aging, maturity, and American identity on screen form the crux of our discussion, and the course explores these topics in relation to race and rituals of belonging, sexuality and body horror, and the commodification of youth and American identity.

The films included, roughly, one from each decade since the 1950's: *The Wild One*, *West Side Story*, *Carrie*, and *The Breakfast Club*. The students selected the films for the '90s and '00s, and they chose *10 Things I Hate About You* and *21 Jump Street*.

<h3><a name="ENWR1510Musical"></a>ENWR 1510: "The Musical: Then and Now"</h3>
  
This themed freshman writing course is based around various forms of the musical from the 1950's to the present. Beginning with a broad consideration of the role of arts in the marketplace and public life, the course then examines more "classic" musicals alongside newer works as a way of discussing the musical's continued and evolving relevance to everyday American life. The course familiarizes students with a variety of different genres of real world writing, print and digital: the academic article, the book chapter, the newspaper article, the blog post, and the comment thread, to name a few. We discuss the challenges of each uniqe mode in the service of distilling the expectations of readers in an academic and professional setting. The musicals: *Singin' in the Rain*, *The Muppets*, *West Side Story*, *Rocky Horror Picture Show*, *Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog*, *Glee*, *Pitch Perfect*, and several music videos as distant cousins of the form.

<h3><a name="ENGL3820"></a>ENGL 3820: "History of Literature in English II"</h3>

From UVA's course description:  
A literary history of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, spanning the period between the epic of Milton and the rise of Modernism. The course is a study in landmark events, including the rise of the novel, the epoch of Romanticism, the age of Victoria, and the emergence of American literature as collaborator (and competitor) with the English tradition. Itâ€™s also an encounter with notable writers, -- among them Fielding, Austen, Blake, Keats, Dickens, Emerson, Hawthorne, Melville, Whitman, Dickinson, Eliot and Wilde. The method of the course will be to ask students to concentrate on a limited number of memorable texts and to offer wider contexts within the lectures. We're particularly interested in arguments for the place of reading, literature, and the humanities in a digital age.  English majors, possible English majors, and non-English majors all warmly welcome.

<h3><a name="ENWR3800"></a>ENWR 3800: "Academic and Professional Writing"</h3>

From UVA's course description:  
 An upper-level course in academic and professional writing. In this course, students learn to control and produce a range of stylistic and persuasive effects. Combining a weekly lecture with a weekly small-group studio session, the course is designed for students who want to further hone their own writing skills, as well as for students preparing for managerial careers in which they will be responsible for the writing produced by their colleagues. In the lectures, students explore recent research in writing studies. In the workshop-based studio sessions, students propose, write, and edit projects of their own design. (Meets second writing requirement.)
