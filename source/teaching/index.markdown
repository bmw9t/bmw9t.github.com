<h4>"The Musical: Then and Now"</h4>

Fall 2012, Spring 2013

<a href="{{ root_url }}/teaching/The Musical Then and Now.pdf">Syllabus</a>

This themed freshman writing course is based around various forms of the musical from the 1950's to the present. Beginning with a broad consideration of the role of arts in the marketplace and public life, the course then examines more "classic" musicals alongside newer works as a way of discussing the musical's continued and evolving relevance to everyday American life. The course familiarizes students with a variety of different genres of real world writing, print and digital: the academic article, the book chapter, the newspaper article, the blog post, and the comment thread, to name a few. We discuss the challenges of each uniqe mode in the service of distilling the expectations of readers in an academic and professional setting. The musicals: *Singin' in the Rain*, *The Muppets*, *West Side Story*, *Rocky Horror Picture Show*, *Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog*, *Glee*, *Pitch Perfect*, and music videos as a distant cousin.
