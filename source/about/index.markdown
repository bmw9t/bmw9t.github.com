<p>I am Visiting Assistant Professor of English and Mellon Digital Humanities Fellow in the Library at Washington and Lee University. I received my PhD and MA from the <a href="http://www.engl.virginia.edu">Department of English</a> at the <a href="http://www.virginia.edu">University of Virginia</a>, where I also held fellowships in the <a href="https://www.scholarslab.org">Scholars' Lab</a>. I work at the intersections of modern and contemporary literature and culture, sound studies, and digital humanities. The diss was on sound recordings in and out of modernist literature, though these days I also think a lot about digital text analysis, open access publishing and resources, and digital pedagogy. In the past, I've worked on <a href="https://www.prism.scholarslab.org">Prism (not the NSA one)</a>, <a href="https://www.nines.org">NINES</a>, and <a href="https://www.groundsforargument.org">Grounds for Argument</a>. Here to help. Check out links above for more information on recent digital work and research.</p>
