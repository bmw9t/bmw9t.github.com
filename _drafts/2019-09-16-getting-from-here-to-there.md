Hey friends! How is it going? I'm Brandon Walsh, the head of student programs in the Scholars' Lab in the UVA Library. That's a center for experimental scholarship informed by digital humanities, spatial technologies, and cultural heritage thinking. For the purposes of our conversation today, my work with students is probably most relevant. I run a number of different fellowship programs and student opportunities in the lab, where I'm in charge of everything from mundane administrative tasks to more abstract things like constructing our pedagogical mission. I work with students from a range of disciplines. I've titled this thing a bit egotistically "Getting from Here to there" - a quote that I'll get to in a bit. [ icebreaker slide ]

THANKS

But first I'd like to get to know you just a little - Sarah has given me some information about your projects - just a little. But I'd like to know more about you. So if you would, let's go around and say your name, what you work on, something else about you the person, and anything you might especially REALLY want us to talk about. Then what your worst haircut ever was. This icebreaker came to me from my wife, and it hasn't failed me yet. But it depends on you playing along. So I'll give you a few moments to think about your haircut. In the meantime I'm going to give you just a brief preview of what's to come. [plan slide]

After we ALL BECOME BEST FRIENDS, I will take you through a series of questions related to project planning (extremely roughly) organized as how, what, who, and why. I have a roadmap through the topic, and I'm happy to just lecture at you. But it'd be great to have questions and discussion as relevant and necessary. So please do interrupt. The conversation will be better for your contributions and better for your ideas. Ultimately this is about making it useful for you. So tell me what you need, and I’m happy to go where you want. I won’t necessarily have all the answers, but I’m happy to talk together. But first, let's ice break.

[ back to other slide ]

[ probably five minutes of ice breakers ]

Good now we’re all best friends [ slide man standing in hallway ]. I titled this “Getting from here to there” because, to me, that’s the most difficult thing about planning any project, but particularly so a digital humanities project for students. I like this image because the alt text for it, the text meant to describe its contents for accessibility purposes, is “man standing in hallway.” It showed up when I did search on Unsplash for “future.” I don’t know about you, but I have a hard time seeing a person in that photo. And when you’re starting out with any kind of digital project that’s part of the challenge. How do you get your project from here to there? And how do you place yourself within it?

[slide baby at first step] Now I’m just trying to show you snazzy images. What is the single biggest question you have right now about getting started? [pause for them to share their own questions] Those are all excellent questions. And part of the message I want you to take away today is that questions like that are all normal. *It is normal not to know the answers*. In fact, I would even wager that some (all?) of you might have another question. [slide imposter syndrome]

When am I going to be exposed for the fraud that I am? I have no idea what I’m doing – when am I going to be found out? I am here to tell you today that everyone feels this way. And if you don’t – you’re a jerk. This feeling – imposter syndrome – is something we live with all through our lives. And it shows that you’re a good, thoughtful, reflective, well-meaning person. This article by Tanya X. Short has some excellent strategies for working through your feelings of imposterdom. I recommend it. But I also recommend you take a deep breath, close your eyes, and recognize that you belong here. You can do this project, and you have a community of people here to help you. I’m also happy to help in any way I can if you want to reach out later on after this event. But more practically, there are some helpful resources and methods I can share with you for how you can get started. Because one way you can address imposter syndrome is by doing what you always do as academics. Do research. Prepare. Use the resources available to you. The process really isn’t quite so different with digital work, though it is in a few different ways that I can help you think through. I have a series of questions that I usually talk through with newcomers to digital projects as they’re thinking for the first time. Reminder: interrupt me at any time. To begin. [slide – how will you]  

How will you go about your work? On a day-to-day basis, what is the process by which you will carry out your work? You might be getting to the point where you have good,  personal project management styles that work for you as you’re writing your dissertation. If you don’t, now is a good time to develop them. But it can always be helpful to hear about other strategies. Know thyself in the first instance – find what works for you and stick to it. But don’t be afraid to try out something new. [ slide – trello]

Who here has heard of Trello? We don’t explicitly use this one in the Scholars’ Lab, but we use it on the technical board for one of the journals I’m involved with – the Journal of Interactive Technology and Pedagogy. It’s pretty simple, the idea is that each task gets a card associated with it that you can comment on and move around. Nothing too earth shattering here, but these sort of task management systems are very important as your projects become more complex and very important if you are working with collaborators! They’re especially good exercises for humanities projects in particular because we’re not used to thinking in terms like this. How do you take a complicated humanities problem and break it into smaller, completable steps? Doing this with technical work can help keep you sane. You’ll likely be bad at it at first and have trouble with task managing. That’s OK! It’s a skill you can develop like anything else. [slide agile]

If you’ve ever talked to anyone else about the way that they work, you’ve probably realized that everyone takes on projects in different ways. Even writing. When I was writing my dissertation, I would use the “add comment” feature in Microsoft Word to leave myself tasks on the document itself. Any page would have hundreds of comments. Digital work is no different. But it’s helpful to have everyone on the same page. There are different philosophies that companies or labs of groups of people working together adopt when working on digital work – in the Scholars’ Lab, we use an approach to project management called Agile Development. The basics of it are before you. The general idea is that you work in two-week sprints. At the end of each sprint you reflect on where you’re at, what you need help with, and what you need for next steps. A scrum is a term taken from rugby, and it is a set of tools and methodologies for conducting these kinds of check in’s. In our scrums, for example, we will go around the room and ask for two-minute updates max describing one thing you did, one thing that is next for you, and one thing you need help from someone else for. But for your purposes, you can just think of it as a two-week sprint followed by meetings. And then you repeat. We do this with our fellows, who have biweekly scrums with their R&D points of contact.

That explains the center of the image. The left refers, I believe, to the idea that you should break your larger project down into smaller tasks that you can accomplish in a two-week sprint. That way you have a good sense of progress. In a student project situation, this might be as simple as “I’m going to work through this chapter from this programming book and come to you with the progress I’ve made and the questions I’ve done.”  One last thing here – notice the emphasis on the circle and the word “potentially.” One of the hearts of agile development is the idea that iteration is good. It actually saves you time, energy, and, in the corporate world, money to produce something early that might be half baked and get feedback on it. The idea there is that you can learn from your mistakes and iterate on it. It requires a certain amount of humility to do so, and it’s somewhat different from what we’re used to in academia. Produce something for other eyes? *Before it’s perfect?* Perish the thought. [ slide – cult of done]

But truly – I’m here to tell you that perfectionism, while often encouraged in academia, can be a significant barrier (and hint – also a cause of imposter syndrome) to getting things done. This is a document that I adore that gets at this point. “Accept that everything is a draft.” Your project is a draft. You’re a draft! It helps to think about ourselves as works in progress. This isn’t something from the agile community per se, but they have overlapping concerns. Iteration is a part of our practice. It’s how we learn. It’s worth considering that not everyone is equally able to iterate or fail in public, as it were – women, people of color, and other maginalized communities have different experiences of the world and of digital life. But it’s worth trying to push yourself to iterate a bit more than you’re comfortable with, in spaces that allow you to do so. [slide agile principles]

One last note on agile. The agile community released a series of principles that are worth pausing over. I’ll read them. Individuals and interactions over processes and tools. Working software over comprehensive documentation. Customer collaboration over contract negotiation. Responding to change over following a plan. So keep in mind that this comes from the software world. Let’s take a moment to think about them. What do you notice about them? How might these apply to your own work as a humanities student? As a dh student? [pause for discussion – try to get them to bring out questions of iteration, communication, self-reflection, pausing] Here are my own translations of them. We’ll talk more about some of these elements soon. [slide – what]

PAUSE FOR QUESTIONS

Everything we’ve talked about so far could be filed under the how category – but, at this early stage, you’re probably also thinking about the what. What exactly do I want to do? One project management tip – this can be a dangerous question. Working with humanities students and faculty it’s all too common to want your idea to go deeper, further, more complex. Instead, I want to suggest you think about this, related question as an enlivening one. [slide – what don’t you]

Instead ask – “What don’t you (or I) want to do?” It’s a powerful question. But it is very, very hard to ask it of yourself. And it really is something that only comes to be meaningful to you with experience. You learn the value of it the hard way. Put another way, check out this image – [slide feature creep]

Feature creep refers to a tendency for projects to creep along, growing in size, way beyond their original intention. And at a certain point, like this tool here, it becomes unweildy and useless. We’ve all had tools like this – so many options that you can’t do anything at all. This is especially a problem in an area like digital humanities because you don’t really know what’s possible and what’s feasible. This is common issue. Even among professionals. [slide wayne]

Here is Wayne Graham, former head of R&D in the Scholars’ Lab, talking about how he takes staff estimates for projects. He takes any estimate his staff gives him and multiples by pi, because things always take longer. Now here [slide bethany] is a quote from the former head of the Scholars’ Lab, the person Wayne reported to. “I take whatever estimate Wayne gives me and double it.” I think of this as what we might call the two pi rule – that’s a lot longer than expected! In the face of those kinds of difficulties, it’s helpful to have some sort of a system in place for determining the value of your work. Here’s one [slide - checklist]  

Here’s a checklist for you as you go about your work. Is this feature hard? Is it important? These are questions that are difficult to answer when starting out, so it can be good to ask for help as you decide them. But it’s also a skill that you can develop over time. So take the time to try to break your large project into as many components as possible. Take the idea of a digital archive. That’s a big thing. But you could poke at a lot of pieces of it. Say…you were going to make an archive of American protest. What are some decisions you would have to make about it? What would some features be? [pause for discussion - maybe note that librarians are forced to speculate about things they don't know the answers to all the time] Will the archive be private or public? Will it index everything about the topic from all countries in all years? Maybe just one year? Maybe just one country? All types of media? Maybe just text? Will people be able to add to it? If they can add to it, will you have to moderate their contributions? You’ll start to see that there are many different ways you can slice up a big idea. And any one of these decisions could potentially blow your project up and make it unwieldy. Start small, and, remember – a project that is all things for all people is probably nothing for no one. [slide visualizing it]

That checklist is actually pretty common one, and this visualization probably seems like common sense. But I still think it’s powerful to see in front of you. Take a moment to look at it. [pause for a moment] Where do you think you want to live (top left). Where do you want to avoid (bottom right). Not too difficult to tell that because this visualization gives you helpful names for each category. This sort of task-oriented thinking isn’t something we’re used to doing. But it’s helpful to think about your work this way. Even something as abstract as writing can benefit from this! In my own situation – I’m a full-time, 12-month, 40 hour staff person, but I still try to write, publish, and (as you can see) give talks. Trying to finish writing projects when you have the regular standing commitments of a job is difficult. I only have so many hours in the work week. Methods like these help me to figure out how long I have to write, what I can accomplish, and what I can’t. [slide – little prince]

One last quote on this that I want to leave you with. Saying no is a super power. Truly. I’ve said in the Scholars’ Lab before that the best projects – the best features – are the ones you say no to. Because saying no to something in the short-term means that, in the long-term, you can say yes to something you really want to do. [slide – support]

PAUSE FOR QUESTIONS

The next question is a big one for students. What kind of support do you have? It’s one thing to talk about these things in a vaccuum, but it’s another to come up against the actual realities of project development. You all have lives. You have programs you’re trying to do. This is hard. But good news is that you’re not alone. [slide – MLA IT]

For one, I wanted to point you a blog post put out by the MLA committee on information technology on how to begin thinking about putting together a digital dissertation. There are a number of good resources linked here that I would encourage you to check out. Guidelines for evaluating digital work. Models of work that has already been done. Any difficulties you might face from a project development standpoint, from a committee buy-in standpoint, from a university standpoint – it is highly unlikely you are the first ones to have these issues. So look for evidence, help, support, resources from the larger community. [ slide – collaborators bill of rights]

I’m certain there are people locally – students, staff, librarians, faculty – as well who are in your corner. Sarah has already told me a little about this. Take advantage of them – in the sense that you accept their help. But I would encourage you to think of this work as an opportunity to start to develop a space more like what you would want the academy to be like. This is an image of the collaborators bill of rights. Digital work takes many hands. Share generously. Credit liberally. Make sure that everyone all the way down is acknowledged in your project, in as many places as you can. Consider how you can make these people your true collaborators if they are up for it – ask them how they want to be cited. Ask them if they want to co-present with you. These things might seem weird, but I can assure they mean the world to people in libraries. This is not just about projects. It’s about people. And you can use this space to begin to help shape a more expansive, generous, and humane way of doing digital work. In the Scholars’ Lab, for example, we push for real collaborations. We do work with – not for – as much as we can. Think about how you can flatten the hierarchies at work in the academy. There is also a student collaborators bill of rights from UCLA you might check out. [slide – principles]

PAUSE FOR QUESTIONS

When we talk about how to structure relationships, one tool we use in the Scholars’ Lab is a thing called a charter. It’s the last tool/idea that I wanted to introduce you to. It’s a pretty simple idea – it’s a document that reflects your shared values and principles. What you expect of each other, how you’re going to work together. What you hope to get out of the thing. Think of it like a personal mission statement. It’s something that a group can return to, later, when questions come up. Articulating values like this are really useful because when the rubber hits the road you can ask of any new feature, project, idea, does this connect with the things I care about? Is it advancing our mission, or at least our mission as we want to see it? This is the charter for our first Praxis cohort. We’ve had students on that collaborative fellowship put one together every year, and we have several for the lab as well – one for the lab in general and another for how we approach student programs.

The reason I end with it is that it connects to the last principle here. [slide – last principles]. Which is that a project is only as good as it connects to you. Because we encourage our students to think about charters as an opportunity to not just articulate the project goals but also their goals for their own portion of the project. What do they hope to gain? How do they hope to grow? What do they acknowledge as their own limitations? A project should, in some way, help you in your life. It’s going to get you to a place you want to be. I thought of my dissertation as a story that I wanted to sit with and a story I wanted to tell for a years. Put another way, how is your project going to help you tell your story? Or more specifically – what kind of person do you want your project to be? How can the telling help you to bring that person into reality? That’s to say nothing of the content. It might be as simple as “this content is important to me.” It could mean “I want to become closely connected with the librarians I work with and learn about their lives.” It could mean that you’re aware of the climate of the academic job market, and you’re using this as an opportunity to develop skills and expertise that can help you in a wide variety of careers. My colleague Jeremy Boggs refers to this as the carrier bag theory of digital humanities. He was referring to archives as collections of things gathered and contextualized in an effort to understand what is going on, what is in process, and who is affected. But he also meant projects in general. A project is more than just the stuff - the disciplinary material - in it. It’s a way for you to make a statement about how you view your work and the world and how you think each should be. That’s why there’s a blank line at the end here. You have to decide what that last line is for yourself. [ slide freire ]

To tip my own hand a little bit, I view my work, basically a lot, as pedagogical work that is engaged in critical digital pedagogy. I had this quote by Paulo Freire in mind as I was writing this talk. “As beings programmed for learning and who need tomorrow as fish need water, men and women become robbed beings if they are denied their conditions of participants in the production of tomorrow.” There is a lot there, but he’s getting at a few things. For Freire, education should always be a radical act of revolution. Students should always be thoroughly engaged in the process of shaping their own education, and traditional modes of education are modeled on capitalism (he calls it the banking model of education). Instead, students need to be allowed to overturn education as we know it – engage them as teachers. It’s about producing their own tomorrows, but it’s also about producing the tomorrow of education and society. I try to approach the projects I work on – really the students are the projects – with a sense of this animating philosophy in mind. There is a reason for everything I do. Or at least there can and should be! That’s where I’m coming from. That’s how I fill in that empty line. And I want you to think about that why question – it’s not just a why for the content. But also about why for all the steps of project planning. How can your work help engineer the tomorrow you want to see?

So I want to end today by helping each of you engage in some soul searching. With the time we have remaining, we’re going to run a series of exercises and discussions about the kinds of goals and assumptions you’re bringing to this. And we’ll talk things out – I’m happy to spend more time addressing specific questions as well. We can go anywhere you want. Let’s get started.
