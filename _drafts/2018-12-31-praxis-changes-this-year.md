This year in Praxis we're taking a step back from the project per se - deliberately limiting the amount of time the students have to conceptualize the project. Instead, we're trying a number of different things to improve the experience for the students.

Code Lab as a way to force them to work together.
Empowering their individual research interests
Unit on pedagogy

Some things you can distill from this process that might be instructive for people more generally - 

Empower the individual as much as the group identity.
Group identity starts from interlocking subgroups.
Mix thinking with doing together.
Articulate the pedagogy - get the buy in
Collaboration with library faculty member.
