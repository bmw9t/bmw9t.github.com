When I sat down to write this post I had no ideas. That's probably inevitable, given the year of blogging challenge that we're undertaking in the Scholars' Lab. As I often do in those situations I got out a deck of cards and started playing. 

I've been obsessed with _Oblique Strategies_ for years now. If you're not familiar, _Oblique Strategies_ is a deck of cards published by Brian Eno and Peter Schmidt that aims to offer short, pithy suggestions for getting around creative dilemmas. The idea behind them is that the serendipity of drawing a mysterious phrase from the deck will help disrupt any blocks you might have moving forward. 


I've got a stack of them that I keep on my desk, and it's a comfort to know that I've always got a wrench to throw in the gears at any given time. This morning as I flipped through these were the cards that came up first:

* When is it for?
* Use an old idea
* Turn it upside down
* Once the search is in progress, something will be found
* Humanize something free of error

A lot there! Of course, these saying don't need to apply only to creative work, and I'm not the first one to think about how _Oblique Strategies_ might apply to DH. Mark Sample's keynote for ILiADS "Your Mistake was a Vital Connection: Oblique Strategies for the Digital Humanities" does a fantastic job articulating the potential for the deck to inspire digital humanities work. Sample advocates not just using the deck as a means in themselves - he suggests making serendipty the process and outcome itself. Put more plainly: the deck can be quirky way to step over difficulty and get back to the serious business of doing work, but it can also offer a reframing of what the work could look like in the first place. 

As I re-read that keynote, I began to wonder how we might take such a framing and apply it more specifically to digital pedagogy.

It's about framing a creative approach to teaching wherein we focus more on process than the outcome (the content). 

A few examples - pencil and paper exercises; speculative design workshops;
