When I sat down to write this post I had no ideas. That's probably inevitable, given the year of blogging challenge that we're undertaking in the Scholars' Lab. The whole point is to write often and frequently, that there is virtue in a steady stream of thoughts rather than waiting for the perfect blog post. And that regular writing makes the whole thing easier. Still, all those good intentions didn't help me as I struggled to put text to document. As I often do in those situations I got out a deck of cards and started playing. 

I've been obsessed with _Oblique Strategies_ for years now. If you're not familiar, _Oblique Strategies_ is a deck of cards published by Brian Eno and Peter Schmidt that aims to offer short, pithy suggestions for getting around creative dilemmas. The idea behind them is that the serendipity of drawing a mysterious phrase from the deck will help disrupt any blocks you might have moving forward. I've got a stack of them that I keep on my desk, and it's a comfort to know that I've always got a wrench to throw in the gears at any given time. This morning as I flipped through the deck for inspiration these were the cards that came up first:

* When is it for?
* Use an old idea
* Turn it upside down
* Once the search is in progress, something will be found
* Humanize something free of error

A lot there! I've been trying to use these monthly posts to reflect on digital pedagogy. Surely, somewhere in there, I could find material for a successful blog post. I did, and I could. But the activity interested me more: how could these cards - the idea of them moreso than any one phrase on them - inform teaching within the field of DH more generally? 

Of course, there is nothing new under the sun. I'm not the first one to think about how _Oblique Strategies_ might apply to DH. Mark Sample's keynote for ILiADS "Your Mistake was a Vital Connection: Oblique Strategies for the Digital Humanities" does a fantastic job articulating the potential for the deck to inspire digital humanities research and pedagogy. Sample advocates not just using the deck as a means to an end - he suggests making serendipty the process and outcome itself. Put more plainly: the deck can be quirky way to step over difficulty and get back to the serious business of doing work, but it can also offer a reframing of what the work could look like in the first place. 

Sample frames using _Oblique Strategies_ in DH research and pedagogy as a question of embracing serendipty as a metheodology. This seems to me to be right and correct, but his piece also makes me want to think further about how _Oblique Strategies_ might offer ways for thinking through digital pedagogy in particular. Besides shuffling up any of those cards and thinking about any specific aphorism's applicability to teaching in a DH context, what might a larger approach to digital pedagogy look like when informed by oblique strategies? Sample offers serendipty as a way into the text, but this is only one to think about the cards. After all, embracing chance as a metheodology involves releasing something else - control. 

Take Sample's description of how Eno: "How might oblique strategies not only be another way to work in general, but specifically, another way to work with the digital scholarship and pedagogy we might otherwise more comfortably approach head-on, as Brian Eno put it." This reading frames use of the cards as a question of directionality but also of power - rather than assert power, give yourself over to the chance of the thing and step in from the side. In order to play the game as invited by _Oblique Strategies_, you have to first accept you might not have all the answers. 

ANOTHER PAR HERE ABOUT POWER AND REFLECTION For me, this question of authority is the clearest link between 



Towards the end of Sample's blog post he puts together a playful tool for generating your own oblique strategies for digital humanities. Below are my own reflections on how we might approach digital pedagogy obliquely, expressed in the aphoristic style of _Oblique Strategies_. I had originally intended to give brief glosses about how they might be interpreted, but I think that gets away from the spirit of the thing. In a riff on Wallace Stevens' "Thirteen Ways of Looking at a Blackbird," I'll give thirteen:

DO THESE WORK - DO YOU NEED TO REFLECT ON THEM ANYMORE?
