I should say that everything that follows is born out of my own experiences with pedagogical training and discussions - your mileage may vary. If you have had wildly different experiences I would love to hear more about them. 

Amanda asked me to write a little about my pedagogy and things that have helped me find it. When someone asks me to do such a thing I always think about this poll that Jesse Stommel put out on Twitter about pedagogical training in your graduate program. 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Dear higher education teachers, a poll.

I consider myself in the “basically nothing” category. My program did have a single semester of pedagogical training, but for a variety of administrative reasons it was possible to slip through the cracks and start teaching without any formal training doing it. This is not to say there was no teaching _support_ - we did teach with the help of a faculty mentor while TA’ing, and we did have each other. But that kind of catch-as-catch-can approach to pedagogical training leaves you with what feels like a very spotty background and a load of imposter syndrome about what you’re doing as a teacher. 

So in some ways, this post is a letter to myself six years ago. It talks about steps I’ve taken to develop a stronger sense of myself as a teacher. 

What is a pedagogy

As Jim said - you want every decision you make in the classroom to be informed by a pedagogy. What you’re already doing might be a function of unexamined underlying beliefs. Or, you might be doing things without realizing that you have other choices.

example of when you were writing your first syllabus and trying to insert as many rules as possible.

It's worth noting too, that teaching happens in many shapes and sizes - courses, workshops, week-long institutes, one-on-one mentoring. Similarly, your pedagogy can manifest itself in a variety of ways - course design, AND MORE

Steps to take

1. Think about what you’re doing and the choices you’ve made.

2. Recognize that they are choices.

3. Work from specific policy to abstract. 

4. **Observe others teach**. Growing up, you probably spent a lot of time in classrooms as a student. But the irony is that, once it became clear that _you_ would do some teaching, you probably didn't get much of a chance to see how others do it. Education programs generally have student experiences designed to address this gap, but I think it's the case that graduate students in the humanities don't get enough opportunities to observe others. And you can't rely on your memories of what good and bad teaching looked like - it's fundamentally different to be a student than to be an outsider thinking about the logistics of how it all gets put together. So ask others if you can watch them teach. While some people might be self-conscious about it, you'll get some takers. And while you're watching, take notes about everything from the students to the teacher. 

5. **Talk with others you respect about teaching**. This point goes well with the last one. It often works well to give context to what goes on in the session. If the instructor has a lesson plan prepared in advance, ask them to send it to you (or at least a few sentences about what they're planning to do). After the session, ask if you can follow up to talk about what you saw. Keep in mind that you're asking the observee to do work for you. I sometimes offer to buy coffee to sweeten the deal if necessary, though this might not be financially possible for you. You might also offer to have them observe you in turn. When talking, it can often be a good entry point into the conversation to ask them how they thought the session went. 

6. **Read and learn more**. Depending on your own background, this fact might get obscured, but pedagogy is an area of study - and research - like any other in academia. There are countless scholars working to advance conversations about pedagogy, and beginning to read around in the field can help you to discover where you fit in. You might start off by reading people discussing teaching as it relates to your specific field to get a general sense, but strong pedagogy frequently transcends the disciplines in which it manifests. As with any discipline, you won't buy everything you read. If you're reading this, odds are you are in some way interested in how we run our student programs in the Scholars' Lab. A pedagogical starter pack for us might look like the following:

* Paulo Friere - *Pedagogy of the Oppressed*
* bell hooks - *Teaching to Transgress*
* Cathy Davidson - *The New Education*
* L. Dee Fink - *Creating Significant Learning Experiences*

As with any good lit review, I find it works well to read for my next citation. So as you're going, keep an eye out for any compelling citations that might offer good opportunities for digging deeper into the conversation in the future. 

7. **Try something new**. You don't need to completely upend your course in order to
