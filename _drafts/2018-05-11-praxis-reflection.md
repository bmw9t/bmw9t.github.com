To do: title. finish writing.
Well, that's a wrap. The Praxis students presented reveal.scholarslab.org to an utterly packed house last Friday (more on that project below), which means that the first full cycle of Scholars' Lab student programs under my watch has taken place. It feels like I just got here, but, as I like to mark milestones, it felt worth reflecting on a few lessons from this year. At the same time, I've found myself often describing a few basic theoretical and practical tensions at the heart of our fellowship programs to anyone who is interested in what we do, so it seems worth writing down my thoughts on them in a wider, more public forum. This post, then, will aim to do both of those things by talking about the line we try to walk between student-centered learning and project-centered learning. In short, I'll be talking about how we figure out what the Praxis program works on each year.

Some background and practical considerations. The Praxis Program is just one of our fellowship programs each year, but, as it serves more students, I think it's safe to say that it takes up the most mental energy of everyone in the lab. Each year, we take six humanities students from various departments around the University (next year we'll have our first Architecture School student!) and offer them a soup-to-nuts introduction to digital humanities work. You can read more about the program on [the project website](http://praxis.scholarslab.org/about/), [the abstract for the poster that was done when the project first launched](http://www.dh2012.uni-hamburg.de/conference/programme/abstracts/realigning-digital-humanities-training-the-praxis-program-at-the-scholars-lab.1.html), or in this [introductory post by Bethany Nowviskie](http://scholarslab.org/grad-student-research/announcing-the-praxis-program/). The program draws together several strands of pedagogical theory, a sampling of which might include Paulo Freire's _Pedagogy of the Oppressed_, the [UCLA Student Collaborator's Bill of Rights](http://cdh.ucla.edu/news/a-student-collaborators-bill-of-rights/). Rather than dig deeper here, I'll just say that we're working on a charter to explicitly lay out more of this context for the work we do. So stay tuned!

One thing I've been thinking a lot about this year is the primary vehicle by which we facilitate the learning process in this program - the project. I usually put it thus: Praxis is a year-long fellowship that has a distinctive shift in feel between the fall and spring semesters. In the fall, there is still a fair amount of us in the front of the class giving workshops to the students, as you might expect from a class where they will be learning a lot of technology. But we also share a range of strategies and techniques that aim to give a high-level look at all the different components of digital work - intellectual property, project scoping and management, collaboration planning, and way more (you can check out the common curriculum [here](http://praxis.scholarslab.org/curriculum/)). Most importantly, we help them think about what they'll be doing together during the year: we help them design and scope a project that they'll be working on in the spring, when we shift to much more of a hands-on, side-by-side, lab approach to the learning experience. While we still think a lot in the spring, our day-to-day work is mostly taken up working together to make the thing happen.

I want to talk about the project that the students work on throughout the year. We want them to build *something*, and how they get to that something has changed over the years. In [another post](http://nowviskie.org/2011/praxis-and-prism/) by Nowviskie above, she mentions that "It’s just too much to ask that students new to digital humanities work invent a meaningful project from whole cloth on Day 1 of the program — especially one that, we hope, will make a meaningful intervention in the current scene of DH research and practice." The compromise in the first few years was to give the students a a piece of vaporware or a project already in progress and, within those restrictions, ask the students to make this kernel of an idea their own and to develop their own intellectual contribution based on it.

Some brief history of these early projects. The first Praxis cohort developed [Prism](http://prism.scholarslab.org), a digital version of a vaporware experiment in collaborative textual analysis and visualization developed by Nowviskie and SpecLab. The second cohort extended Prism, adding in new features based on their own interests and priorities, with the goal of taking the project from a proof of concept to a tool that was more open and usable. Accordingly, Prism has seen significant uptake, particularly in K-12 classrooms, as a pedagogical tool for teaching a variety of reading and interpretive skills. In its third year, the program took a similar approach - the staff tasked the Praxis cohort with developing a new version of [Ivanhoe](http://ivanhoe.scholarslab.org/), another older Scholars' Lab project that was an exercise in collaborative interpretation and literary intervention, that would run as a WordPress theme. The following year, the fourth cohort of students redesigned Ivanhoe further to incorporate allow multimedia contributions.

So, in one sense, the first four years of the Praxis program were heavily directed. Because of this, the students were saved the difficult task of making a wholesale contribution to a field they were just learning for the first time, and I think this guidance meant that the projects were able to go quite far. Each project ran on a two-year cycle, which meant that one cohort was tasked with the heavy lifting of developing a first pass at the digital project while the next would inherit the intellectual weight of conversations they hadn't participated in. The next two years were even more student-directed. The students still were given wide latitude over the kinds of skills they took away and the nature of the project that developed at the end, but certain productive constraints were used to guide the work of the group.

Years five and six stepped back a bit more and did not explicitly give a project to the students. Rather than being given an explicit project, they were given an idea. The students were told to think about the concept of time and develop a project that would intervene in our understanding of it. Naturally, the slightly more free-form approach meant that the students had the leeway to take wildly different approaches. The fifth cohort developed [ClockWork](http://clockwork.scholarslab.org/), which used sonification to grapple with the monetary measurements of time. The sixth cohort took time as encouragement to think about social media as the best representation of the now, and these investigations led them to think about the social media ecologies of the Kardashian family. In the seventh year, we stepped back even more, and the seventh cohort of students developed [UVA Reveal: Augmenting the University](http://reveal.scholarslab.org/), a project that used augmented reality to layer contextual information onto public spaces to challenge public narratives of contested spaces. 

In the Scholars' Lab, we're committed to putting the students in charge of their education. But it's a delicate balance to strike - how much freedom to design their own education do you give students? How much do you shape the thing for them? The answers depend on a number of things:

Your inclination (know thyself)
Your circumstances (what is even possible for you)
Your resources
Your content
Your student

The plan for this year as its going down
This year we're taking a step back from the project per se - deliberately limiting the amount of time the students have to conceptualize the project.
The specific things we're doing to try to help facilitate a group project.
Code Lab as a way to force them to work together.
empowering their individual research interests

Some things you can distill from this process that might be instructive for people more generally - 

Empower the individual as much as the group identity.
Group identity starts from interlocking subgroups.
Mix thinking with doing.
Articulate the pedagogy - get the buy in
