Part of my job involves helping students professionalize in digital humanities, which often means being there when students get accepted to their first digital humanities conference. Since most of my students come from the humanities, those conversations often go something like this:
Student: "I got accepted to the big digital humanities conference!"
Me: "That's so exciting! you should be very proud."
**two months pass**
Student: "Wait what should I be expecting at this conference? People read their talks right?"
Me: "Well…it's complicated……"

The answer, of course, is that it depends. The main complication comes from the fact that in my experience DH presentations seem to cover the full spectrum of approaches public speaking. Some people dutifully read a talk they have written ahead of time. I'd say most get by with talking from notes, giving a presentation that is more or less extemporaneous. Some seem to speak fully off the cuff with little preparation and pull it off with style (not something I could do). Personal styles vary a lot, and giving a keynote is somewhat different than giving a roundtable response or a short paper presentation.

And the conversation is not too different from one I had with an undergraduate mentor back when I was just coming into graduate school and was accepted to my first conference. I had no real experience with academia at all - no friends or family who had worked on graduate degrees that weren't pre-professional; no humanities grads in my network - so I did not know what an abstract was, what a talk was, or how the two interacted with the other. It's worth keeping in mind that these things are all learned, socialized behaviors that no one comes in knowing, regardless of degree program, except by circumstance, background, or association with someone else who can let you know. 

So on the off-chance that this information is useful to someone out there I thought I would make a few notes about the way I go about preparing for talks. The way I do things feels somewhat idiosyncratic, which perhaps makes it all the more worth sharing. I finally decided it was worth sharing after walking around the Chicago airport prepping for my DH 2018 talk. To begin, it's helpful to compare the two main approaches to giving DH talks that I outlined above. I think they probably hold true for most forms of public speaking, though one genre of talk might be less socially accepted depending on the context:

**When reading a written paper…**
- You are more likely to stick to the time limit. It's easier to plan when you know each page is roughly two minutes.
- You already have something written up that can easily be repurposed or shared online. It's harder to get back in the conference headspace and write a thing up with every passing moment after a conference.
- You'll probably find the experience easier on the nerves, as all you have to do is keep reading and talking. Before you know it, the bulk of the talk will be done.
- You can seem dull unless you take steps to perform your reading very well. After all, it's hard to stay engaged when someone is just reading aloud for 15 to 20 minutes (let alone an hour). This isn't universally true - some people are quite adept at performing their reading of a presentation. And some (non-DH contexts in particular) virtually expect you to be reading. 
- But, then again, you'll actually say everything you mean to say in the order you mean to say it. That's worth a lot!

**When speaking from notes…**
- You're more likely to be engaging. It's easier for you to inject a sense of personality in your talk. This is usually the big one for people.
- It is more difficult to predict how long you will talk for. If you take out the rough rule of two minutes to a 12 point Times New Roman page it's more difficult to know exactly what you're in for. Will you get through everything? Will you run out of time?
- Beyond pace, you might leave something out, or you might not say something in exactly the best way to express your ideas.
- You won't have a written product ready to go at the end, so that makes more work for you if you want to share the talk. 

People have quite strong opinions about each, but I've always felt that there is no one correct answer. In one session you might see someone looked down upon for reading, but then in the next session a speaker might try and go from notes, go way over time, and never get through more than the introduction. Both can be done well, and both can be done poorly. 

I don't write this to convince anyone that one form is better - I always feel like it depends on a lot of personal factors. How anxious does public speaking make you? What makes you most comfortable? My approach tries to split the differences. I should say at the outset that I am not necessarily advocating this for everyone. It feels a bit strange, but it's a workflow that I have come to like quite a lot. Here it is:

1. I write the talk.
2. I record myself giving the talk and make an MP3 of it.
3. I use [a great tool](ronimusic.com) used by musicians to divide up the talk into sections. 
4. I listen to that MP3 a bunch while walking around the airport, doing chores, driving; etc.

I use a great tool used by musicians to help facilitate this process. [The Amazing Slow Downer](ronimusic.com) allows you to do all sorts of useful things for working with audio, including slowing and speeding up a recording without changing the pitch to facilitate learning things by ear. You're probably not going to use most of its features if learning a talk, but it does have a pretty handy slicing and looping tool that can make it easier to divide a talk into segments and learn one piece at a time. 


The result is that by the time I give a talk the thing has been rattling around in my head for days or weeks. I'm usually just as excited to get the content of my talk out of my head and move on as I am to actually discuss the material! I don't ever quite memorize the talks, but I do come close in a lot of cases. The good thing, though, is that I don't really need to memorize them. After
