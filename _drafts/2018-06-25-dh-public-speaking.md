Part of my job involves helping students professionalize in digital humanities, which often means being there when students get accepted to their first digital humanities conference. Since most of my students come from the humanities, those conversations often go something like this:
Student: "I got accepted to the big digital humanities conference!"
Me: "That's so exciting! you should be very proud."
**two months pass**
Student: "Wait what should I be expecting at this conference? People read their talks right?"
Me: "Well…it's complicated……"

The answer, of course, is that it depends. The main complication comes from the fact that in my experience DH presentations seem to cover the full spectrum of approaches public speaking. Some people dutifully read a talk they have written ahead of time. I'd say most get by with talking from notes, giving a presentation that is more or less extemporaneous. Some seem to speak fully off the cuff with little preparation and pull it off with style (not something I could do). Personal styles vary a lot, and giving a keynote is somewhat different than giving a roundtable response or a short paper presentation.

The way I do things feels somewhat idiosyncratic, so I finally decided it was worth sharing after walking around the Chicago airport prepping for my DH 2018 talk. To begin, it's helpful to compare the two main approaches to giving DH talks that I outlined above:

Reading a written paper
- Far more reliably stick to time
- Already have something written up that can easily be repurposed or shared online
- Can often seem quite dull unless done very well
- Easy on the nerves, as all you have to do is keep talking

Speaking from notes
- More engaging
- Takes a lot of practice and experience to time well
- A bit more difficult to predict
- No written product ready to go at the end, so requires more work to share

People have quite strong opinions about each, but I've always felt that there is no one correct answer. In one session you might see someone looked down upon for reading, but then in the next session a speaker might try and go from notes, go way over time, and never get through more than the introduction. Both can be done well, and both can be done poorly. 

My approach tries to split the differences. I should say at the outset that I am not necessarily advocating this for everyone. It feels a bit strange, but it's a workflow that I have come to like quite a lot.
