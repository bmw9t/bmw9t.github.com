Everything I know about teaching I learned from Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch.

In my graduate program we started teaching in our second year. Teaching was something I had looked forward to for a long time. I knew that I would enjoy it – for years I had taught music in various contexts, and that work had been fulfilling and joyful even when it was teaching a group of middle schoolers group trumpet lesson. I looked forward to working with a larger group, working through knotty questions with students, and discussing that texts that were difficult but enriching.  

Only one problem – training. Due to a number of administrative reasons, people coming into my particular program with my particular background skipped the required course on pedagogy. It was a consequence of of being an MA transfer - the extra degree meant that the whole graduate degree was slightly accelerated, and the pedagogy class was the one that suffered. It was the fall of 2011. My course was starting in a couple weeks, and I had no idea what I was doing.

I was serving as a teaching assistant, meaning that I ran a discussion section for a larger lecture course. In some ways, this meant my job was easy. I had a course ready to go with lectures and a syllabus, all provided by someone else. But once a week I had the students all to myself for a discussion of the week's material. I had been in classes like that for decades, but I suddenly found myself unable to remember how any of them looked. Once I walked into that room with that group of people - once I had them to themselves - what did I do? How did I get them talking? Was talking even what we were supposed to be doing together? 

I couldn't have a full course in pedagogy before teaching, but, as luck would have it, the Center for Teaching Excellence at UVA regularly put on workshops for new teachers. They were offering a course the week before the semester started, so I still had a chance. I could get some training! While it couldn’t do much at this late hour, at least I might be able to triage my nerves by seeing what they had to offer. Some of the workshops didn't make sense for me - I wouldn’t be running a lab, and I wasn’t running a homework section for a math course. But I found one that seemed to speak directly to my anxieties - how to run your first day of class. Perfect.

The workshop was packed with other graduate students, and, in the months and years to come, I would actually come to be close friends with some of the people in it. I still remember one piece of advice they gave in the workshop:

> Never have a script that you’re reading from. The only time you should have a script is for the first two minutes of the first class.

That particular script was meant to be pretty basic – give your name, share your department, offer a words about your own interests and excitement for the course, and then you’re off! This seemed easy enough, and it felt like good advice. The idea was that starting the class on a strong footing would allow you to move in any other number of directions. As I recall, their other frame for an initial course was to do some community building and then something - at least one thing - so the students left with a good model for what to expect for the course. 

I went home and set about diligently writing my handful of sentences meant to start semester.

When it came time to start the class I was ready. I got to class early and, to avoid visibly showing signs of my anxiety, I wandered the halls of the building. I think I went to the restroom and just sat on the toilet for a while to kill time. I’m sure my palms were sweaty.

But it was fine because, when the class began, I had my script ready to go. And with it I went. I recited the first bits introducing myself and the course to the students just as I had practiced.

> Hello! I’m Brandon Walsh, a graduate student in literature here.

Somewhere in that second sentence I realized that I had planned out my words but not for what I would be doing with my body. I hadn’t thought about my hands.

> I’m excited to work on this course with you over the course of the semester.

As sometimes happens when I’m nervous or just fidgeting in meetings, my hands had drifted up from my hips to the back of my neck where they stroked the back of my hair. Try as I might, I couldn’t will them to stop. This sort of thing looks fine if you’re sitting down, but I was standing up. By now I had struck this pose so long that it felt like it would be more awkward to self-consciously stop whatever weird dance my hands were doing. Instead I leaned into it. I launched this course on twentieth-century literature much in the same way that Marky Mark aggressively stares into the camera on the cover of On the House Tip.

So I held my pose until I finished my script. It was all pretty embarrassing. To move on I asked a question. I was met with silence. A beat or two passed. And then hands started to move. As if by some miracle and not entirely of their own control, the students felt compelled to engage with me. With the course.

I became friends with some of the students in that class, and a couple years later I shared that story with them. They had no memory of a pose or of anything embarrassing about the first class. I remember pressing further. Surely they remembered the class on _The Waste Land_, which I thought was so bad it must been seared into the memories of everyone in it. Not only did they not remember it being bad - they thought it was the best discussion of the semester.

I tell this story a lot to students who are nervous about their own workshops or presentations. Besides being good for a laugh, it also contains some comforting takeaways. 

The first - students experience the class entirely differently than the instructor. That awkward silence that feels excruciating to you? It might just as well feel like a much-needed moment to reflect to your students.
