In my graduate program we started teaching in our second year. Teaching was something I had looked forward to for a long time. I knew that I would enjoy it – for years I had taught music in various contexts, and that work had been fulfilling and joyful even when it was teaching a group trumpet lesson to a dozen middle schoolers. I looked forward to working with a larger group, working through knotty questions with students, and discussing texts that were difficult but enriching.  

Only one problem – training. People coming into my particular program with my particular background skipped the required course on pedagogy. It was a consequence of of starting the PhD with an MA already in hand - the extra degree meant that the whole graduate degree was slightly accelerated, and the pedagogy class was something that got dropped in the process. It was the fall of 2011. My course was starting in a couple weeks, and I had no idea what I was doing.

I was meant to be serving as a teaching assistant, meaning that I ran a discussion section for a larger lecture course run by a professor. In some ways, this meant my job was easy. I had a course ready to go with lectures and a syllabus provided by someone else. But once a week I had the students all to myself for a discussion of the week's material. I had been in classes like that for decades, but I suddenly found myself unable to remember how any of them looked. Once I walked into that room with that group of people - once I had them to themselves - what did I do? How did I get them talking? Was talking even what we were supposed to be doing together? 

I couldn't have a full course in pedagogy before teaching, but, as luck would have it, the [Center for Teaching Excellence](https://cte.virginia.edu/) at UVA regularly put on workshops for new teachers. They were offering a course the week before the semester started, so I still had a chance. I could get some training! While it could only do so much at this late hour, at least I might be able to triage my nerves by seeing what they had to offer. Some of the workshops didn't make sense for me - I wouldn’t be running a lab in the sciences, and I wasn’t running a homework section for a math course. But I did found one that seemed to speak directly to my anxieties - how to run your first day of class.

The workshop was packed with other graduate students, and, in the months and years to come, I would come to be close friends with some of the people in it. I still remember one piece of advice they gave in the workshop:

> Never have a script that you’re reading from. The only time you should have a script is for the first two minutes of the first class.

That script was meant to be pretty basic – give your name, share your department, offer a words about your own interests and excitement for the course, and then you’re off. This seemed easy enough, and it felt like good, sensible advice. The idea was that starting the class on a strong footing would allow you to move in any other number of directions. As I recall, their other suggestions for an initial course were to do some community building and then teach something - at least one thing - so the students left with a good model for what to expect for the course. This framework might not work in all cases or for all cases, but it was helpful for me as I struggled to think through how to start my first class ever. 

I went home and set about diligently writing my handful of sentences meant to start semester.

When it came time to start the class I was ready. I got to class early and, to avoid visibly showing signs of my anxiety in front of the students, I wandered the halls of the building. I think I went to the restroom and just sat on the toilet for a while to kill time. I’m sure my palms were sweaty.

But it was fine because, when the class began, I had my script ready to go. And with it I went. I recited the first bits introducing myself and the course to the students just as I had practiced.

> Hello! I’m Brandon Walsh, a graduate student in literature here.

Somewhere in that second sentence I realized that I had planned out my words but not for what I would be doing with my body. I hadn’t thought about my hands.

> I’m excited to work on this course with you over the course of the semester.

As sometimes happens when I’m nervous or just fidgeting in meetings, my hands had slid up from my hips, along my sides, to the back of my neck where they stroked the back of my hair. Try as I might, I couldn’t will them to stop. This sort of thing looks fine if you’re sitting down, but I was standing up. By now I had struck a weird pose so long that it felt like it would be more awkward to self-consciously stop whatever weird dance my hands were doing. Instead I leaned into it. It's difficult to describe the exact pose I was doing. Imagine you are relaxing in a hammock, supporting your neck with your hands:

So imagine that, except you're standing and talking in front of a group of students. That's how I launched this course on twentieth-century literature. 

So I held my pose until I finished my script. It was all pretty embarrassing, and to move on I asked the students a question. I was met with silence. A beat or two passed, and then hands started to move. As if by some miracle and not entirely of their own control, the students felt compelled to engage with me. To engage with the course.

I became friends with some of the students in that class, and a couple years later I shared that story with them. They had no memory of the pose or of anything embarrassing about the first class. I remember pressing further. Surely, if not that, they must remember the class I taught on _The Waste Land_, which I thought was so bad it must been seared into the memories of everyone in it. Not only did they not remember it being bad - they thought it was the best discussion of the semester.

I thought this story might be worth sharing because I tell it a lot to students who are nervous about their own workshops or presentations. Besides being good for a laugh, it also contains some comforting takeaways. The first - students experience a class entirely differently than the instructor. That awkward silence that feels excruciating to you? It might just as well feel like a much-needed moment to reflect to your students. As instructors, we can only know so much about how our students experience our work, and we can only control it so much. Second, teaching comes from a place of vulnerability, and good teaching comes from cultivating a space wherein you trust your students and they can trust you. I teach from a privileged position as a cis white man, so my experiences of this vulnerability are different than those of many other teachers. As described by Steph Ceraso, Matthew Pavesich, and Jeremy Boggs in "[Learning as Coordination: Postpedagogy and Design](https://designpedagogy.github.io/introduction/)", "Postpedagogical thinkers understand teaching as the assemblage of learning environments rather than the linear transfer of knowledge from teacher to student. These learning environments are ecologies of spaces, bodies, objects, technologies, problems, and questions." That is to say: I think part of the lesson I had to learn was that I was too hung up on what I would be doing as an instructor. Even if I blanked in the moment, I was not entering a space devoid of all social and institutional expectations about what teaching looked like. 

The training and expertise I've gotten since that time have helped me cultivate a sense of agency as I move through these learning environments. And that same sense of volition (or deliberate handing over of it) is something that we try to instill in the students we work with in the Scholars' Lab. Rather than letting the web shape the world for them, we follow the model of [Domain of One's Own](https://umw.domains/) and encourage our students to own their digital projects metaphorically, literally, and technically. When it comes to digital pedagogy, our students, I think, often come to the brink of teaching their first DH workshop and imagine they'll find themselves like I did, standing in front of the class exposed in a weird posture (as an imposter?). It's helpful for students to know that we've all been there and that they'll get through it. But more than that, we try to offer them a way of thinking that can help them think critically about the space and the way they interact with it, about how they might try their own hand at shaping it.
