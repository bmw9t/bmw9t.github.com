(or some better title)

I mentioned in my [last post](http://walshbr.com/blog/a-praxis-oriented-introduction-to-digital-pedagogy/) that the Scholars' Lab piloted a unit on digital pedagogy for the Praxis Program this past year. I ended it on something of a cliffhanger - as a result of the unit, the students had drafted materials for a low-tech, concept-based introduction to a digital humanities method area relative to their own interests. The unit gave the students the opportunity to teach other elements of their material as they felt way through how they would go about teaching the material, and it also gave us a chance to speak directly to their own reasons for being in graduate school and for exploring digital humanities. I had intended the unit to end there, with each student in possession of all the makings for a DH workshop of their own design. But the students wanted to go a step further - they wanted to actually use these materials and deliver these workshops.

At the same time, I was in contact with the [digital humanities group at Washington and Lee University](http://digitalhumanities.wlu.edu) about an ongoing relationship between them and the Scholars' Lab. Through [this collaboration](https://github.com/wludh/research-one-collab/blob/master/wlu-faculty.md), UVA graduate students working in DH travel to W&L to deliver one-off workshops for undergraduate DH courses. The students work with the relevant faculty member to design a workshop in line with both their own research interests and the course material. It's challenging to coordinate logistically, as W&L's DH Librarian [Mackenzie Brooks](https://mackenziekbrooks.info) and I have to align the schedules for faculty member and students in addition to making good matches between backgrounds and course syllabi. The newly designed workshops seemed like good fits for these programs in spirit, at least, but we were struck by a few problems. Six workshops was *a lot* of sessions. It's difficult to coordinate a couple workshops a semester, let alone six. And we didn't have obvious course fits for some of the topics.

At the same time, Mackenzie and [Sydney Bufkin](https://www.sydneybufkin.com/), Visiting Assistant Professor English and Mellon Digital Humanities Fellow at W&L were co-teaching a small capstone course for W&L minors in Digital Culture and Information. They were eager for their students to get broad exposure to a broad array of DH topics. So the DH roadshow was born! Rather than coordinate six trips to W&L, Mackenzie and I hatched a scheme to reduce that number to two sessions. On two separate occasions, Mackenzie and Sydney brought their capstone students and a post-baccalaureate student to UVA, where they took part in three workshop sessions by our Praxis students.

We had a lot of conversation internally about how to handle these workshops. After all, while the Praxis students were eager to deliver them and get feedback, they were still learned. We worried that throwing the doors open to the general public would be fair to these students who were, after all, teaching in public so as to learn. We wanted to construct a space that helped to mitigate these risks, so we settled on a partially open format, aiming for about fifteen participants total in each workshop. Besides the five participants from W&L, we also counted on about five participants from the Scholar's Lab. For the remaining audience members, we selectively invited members of the UVA community: subject librarians who would be interested in the work being done by students in their departments, experienced and generous collaborators who we could count on to offer constructive feedback, and colleagues who might simply be interested in learning about the method under discussion.

We were also able to pay the students a small sum through the W&L mellon grant to compensate the extra time required to prepare the workshops over and above what we would usually expect of Praxis participants.

These were the topics -

* Mathilda Shepherd (Spanish) - Minimal Computing
* Emily Mellen (Music, Critical and Comparative Studies) - How to Cite and Work with Sound Sources in Writing
* Eleanore Neumann (Art and Architectural History) - Digital Curation
* Cho Jiang (Urban and Environmental Planning) - Sentiment Mapping
* Chris Whitehead (History) - Network Analysis w/ String
* Catherine Addington (Spanish) - Transcription and Digital Editions

Cautionary tales -

this is work for the students
teaching with a safety net
offer a space to discuss the feedback
