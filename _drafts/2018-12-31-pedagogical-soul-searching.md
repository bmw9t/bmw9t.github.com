Most importantly, if you've decided that you need to make some changes to your syllabus, your program, or your assignment, where do you start?
I might offer the following as a preliminary brainstorming list for someone looking to have a group of students working on a digital project (large or small). But I think they also work as a good checklist for anyone who has found themselves tied in pedagogical knots and who wants to change things.

1. Your inclination (know thyself) - One of the most important things you can do as a teacher is to accept yourself. If you are someone who will only be comfortable with a clear plan, avoid putting yourself in situations that will generate unknowns you will have to respond to. If you prefer flexible schedules and outcomes, similarly don't force yourself into rigid plans that you can't adapt for your students. These tendencies are often born of pedagogical strengths, and you should play to them. Be willing to take risks, but also be yourself. Let the pedagogy follow.

2. Your circumstances (what is even possible for you) - It's one thing to say be flexible, but you know your situation. I don't. You might be teaching to a curriculum that doesn't allow the space for students to design a project. A clear project with a clearly defined set of outcomes might be the only option for you because you don't have time and energy for more. This is fine! You don't need to trash a whole syllabus to experiment with digital projects or project-based pedagogy. You can do a lot with a little, and it's OK to start small, with a single assignment or a classroom activity. 

3. Your resources (who and what can help you) - Be mindful of what you're asking. 

4. Your students (who is your audience)

5. Your goals - What are you committed to? Link the charter.

Anyway, this listicle style is just a start. If you've read between the tea leaves here you might have intuited that this has all been self-reflective for me as well. Over the summer we did some soul searching for the Praxis program. I've got another post brewing on the actual changes we made to Praxis this year as a part of these conversations. More soon!
