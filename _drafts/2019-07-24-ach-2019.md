I'm Brandon Walsh, the Head of Student Programs in the Scholars' Lab, a center for experimental scholarship in the University of Virginia Library, where our work is informed by digital humanities, spatial technologies, and cultural heritage. We are a part of and report through the library, and all but one of our employees are currently on hard salary lines. There's much more to be said about nitty gritty things, and I'm happy to speak further in conversation with others about the Lab's positioning and infrastructure. For now, I'll just offer thoughts on this conversation from my own corner of our work, which is primarily student-driven and pedagogically inflected. The points I'll raise aren't ones we have the answers to necessarily, but they’re the work that we’re trying to think through.

I want to begin by situating my ideas in our space. This is a fisheye view of our public area, where students, faculty, and staff can collaborate on projects or get access to particular software packages (particularly GIS). It's one of a few spaces we have, and we share it with the library and the public. Our makerspace is nestled in the back there, and any given day we have a number of people working there, some formally affiliated with us, some not. In the Lab we often say we prioritize building up people over projects. This positioning - this space - both reflects and informs our philosophy in the Scholars’ Lab, which I’ve broken down here into a short list of points. Because of my own role, my remarks will largely deal with students.

A lab's community changes over time.

The Scholars' Lab has a charter that expresses our values, but half of the people who wrote that don't work in the lab anymore (we'll be renewing and rewriting soon). In the context of student work, one thing we think a lot about is how the community we lavish resources on is necessarily going to leave. That’s not a problem per se. But it does lead to a difficult ebb and flow of outreach. It's difficult to establish an identity on such shaky territory.

Point 2. Community definitions include -- and exclude.
We recently had something of a reckoning with our own identity as a digital humanities center - only about a third of our staff identified as DH. When you’re first getting started it’s easy to make choices unknowingly that have ramifications down the line. From the student side of things, we work extensively with graduate students, but far less so with undergraduates. MA students have a more difficult time finding their way into our named programs, and humanities-minded students in the sciences, architecture school, and others have bureaucratic difficulties working with us. Much of my energy these days is spent trying to be more inclusive and inviting.

Point 3. A diverse community requires varied types of support.

Those different groups I mentioned? They all have different needs. You can’t think about just one public or just one student body or just one monolithic Faculty with a capital F. In the context of students, we’re constantly thinking about what meaningful units of support are – course credits, wages, stipends to offset teaching requirements. But there are also other things that are meaningful – help with professional development, emotional support, showing up for their dissertation defenses. All of these things matter, but they matter in different ways to different people. I think it's important to work across all the categories.

Point 4 - Community members will leave.

I think we do a disservice to our students and our community members if we are not thinking about what comes next for them. At the Scholars' Lab, for students this means engaging with a program called PHD+ that tries to prepare students for diverse career outcomes after graduating. For our staff, it means encouraging professional development and recognizing that if they leave to go on to better things that means we've done our job well. That takes work.

Point 5. We can always be better.

How can we be better? That's really the animating question for our student programs these days.

Because we're not just talking about the life of a lab - we're talking about lives in a lab. And we have a responsibility to do right by those people who we teach, we employ, that we work with. For the student programs side of the Lab this means consistently re-reading and re-consulting the Postdoctoral Bill of Rights and the UCLA Student Collaborator Bill of Rights as touchstones for what we do. There are systemic forces structuring the way we interact with our community - and the way you interact with yours. Pushing back against them should be part of the long-term plans for a lab's work. Even if things seem to be going well, someone in our orbit is in a position of precarity - on our staff, one of our students, someone in our community. We can always be better - there is always work to be done. That's the work that we're engaged in right now in the Lab.

I'm happy to talk more. For now I'll yield to the rest of the group.
