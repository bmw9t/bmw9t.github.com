    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>At long last, I am ready to unveil the project that I have been working on over the summer - a design refresh for site. The main drive behind this aesthetic: I noticed the sheer abundance of information that the basic octopress theme gives you. This setup leads to a lot of duplicate information that ultimately makes things feel cluttered. I tried to keep things very minimal in this design, eliminating as much overlapping information and noise as possible.</p>

<p>I used a few different models for the design of the site. The main inspirations came from the sites of <a href="http://aijazansari.com/">Aijaz Ansari</a>, <a href="http://clioweb.org/">Jeremy Boggs</a>, and <a href="http://daniel.inletters.com/">Daniel Carter</a>. Ansari&#8217;s <a href="http://aijazansari.com/2012/08/27/how-to-customize-octopress-theme/">blog post</a> on customizing Octopress, especially, proved essential as I worked through my own setup. There are still a few things that I could stand to change for this current design, but it felt as thought it was time to let the current iteration see the light of day.</p>

<p>A couple issues I ran into:</p>

<p>How minimal is too minimal in an aesthetic like this? I am not crazy about the search bar in the navigation setup, but it does feel necessary to have one. The function there outweighed the desire to keep the aesthetic. In a future refresh, I will probably try to make the search bar a bit more subtle. In addition, at one point I had my links only turn blue when hovered. This looks great, but it presents obvious problems: you never know what is a link. Again, I had to make some sacrifices for the site to function properly.</p>

<p>How to deal with images in a minimal aesthetic? I initially wanted to have some sort of a banner image at the top where my name serves as a heading. I might explore this in the future, but images offer whole new complications. What kind of image texture would keep the aesthetic alive? Content? Color? I punted the issue for now by opting for my name as the banner, but I will be returning to this in the future.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Cross posted on the <a href="http://www.scholarslab.org/praxis-program/looking-forward/">Scholars&#8217; Lab blog.</a></p>

<p>As we move into the second half of our tenure on the <a href="http://praxis.scholarslab.org/">Praxis squad</a>, we are feeling the pressure to start actually making something. To that end, the <a href="http://www.scholarslab.org/">SLab</a> crew asked us to make a list of our priorities for <a href="http://prism.scholarslab.org/">Prism</a>. Hopefully this will help us make a to do list in the coming weeks. The following was the list that seemed to come out of yesterday’s meeting, though it’s possible that other people could have gotten different impressions from the conversation.</p>

<p>These seem to be our priorities, in no particular order except roughly that in which they were brought up:</p>

<p><strong>Types of texts</strong> – we’re interested in opening up the Prism framework to deal with pictures, music, etc.</p>

<p><strong>Getting a crowd</strong> – we want to get a large group of people working with Prism, however that might be arranged.</p>

<p><strong>Visualizations</strong> – we’re interested in expanding Prism’s visualizations to allow you to see the individual set of markings in relation to the crowd and to let you see one marking category’s visualization beside another.</p>

<p><strong>User uploads</strong> – we want to make it possible for users/instructors to upload a text for marking themselves, which we see as essential for classroom use.</p>

<p><strong>Complicating the sense of how we highlight</strong> – there has been discussion of complicating how the marking system works, allowing for a limit to the number of markings or a type of marking economy that is distributed across your selections to encourage different types of engagement with the data.</p>

<p><strong>Design makeover</strong> – we want to remake the design of the site with an eye to usability.</p>

<p>I think my own priorities lie in making it possible for users to upload their own texts for marking and in possibly adding more visualizations. If forced to choose between the two, I would spend the time on making the tool capable of handling user uploads. As quickly became clear, any one of these goals spins off into dozens of other questions. What do we mean by “upload a text”? Will those texts be public? Private? How will we navigate copyright and fair use? In the coming days we’re aiming to get a sense of our collective ordering of the list.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After some Git problems were sorted out and explained to me by the staff of the <a href="http://www.scholarslab.org/">Scholars&#8217; Lab</a>, I can make updates to the site again.
